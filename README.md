# Deep-Learning-from-scratch

My experiments with coding abc's of Deep Learning from scratch. The goal was to code backprop and understand intuitively how pytorch or tensorflow have implemented them.
I also wanted to code RNNs from scratch, it was a long due. Somehow I stayed away from RNN and wanted to change that.

Pending ToDos: Code optimizers like adam and RMSprop
